GRANTS
Rose-Hulman Project Vault, $17,350, Summer 2016.
With Dr. Matt Boutell, proposed and received a KEEN grant to build a prototype of the Rose-Hulman Project Vault web app (rosehulmanprojectvault.org)  and create a new special topics course on Web Development using Angular with Firebase started in Spring 2017.

Entrepreneurially-minded learning in iOS Application Development, $7000, Summer 2015.
Proposed and received a KEEN Course Development grant to add entrepreneurially-minded learning activities to the CSSE484 iOS Development course. The main outcomes were causing students to propose app ideas that added real value to users (vs. any project of their choosing), to investigate what is missing in existing apps, and to respond to feedback from experts.

Mobile Development with Google Cloud Endpoints, $10,000, Summer 2014.
With Dr. Matt Boutell, proposed and received a summer professional development grant from Rose-Hulman. For the project, we created online tutorials (website, videos, and lab exercises) to teach mobile developers (Android, iOS, and Web) how to use cloud storage using the Google Cloud Endpoints backend.

MERI: Multidisciplinary Educational Robotics Initiative: Developing a Robotics Certificate Program at Rose-Hulman, $100,000, 2008-2011.
With Drs. Carlotta Berry, Steven Chenoweth, and Matt Boutell, proposed and received a Lilly Endowment Faculty Success Grant. We developed a new Multidisciplinary Robotics Minor program for students studying Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering. Students take courses in these areas and complete a multidisciplinary robotics senior project. Over 150 Rose-Hulman students have graduated with the robotics minor.  I currently serve as the director of the program.
